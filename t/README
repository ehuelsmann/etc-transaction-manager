Test structure
--------------

A test is considered to mean a .t file. Each test follows the sequence
listed below:

 - Create temporary (test) directory
 - Set up the preconditions for the test
   * Create the correct subdirectories within the test directory
   * Copy test data from the t/data/ directory into the test directory
 - Execute the tests
 - Remove the temporary directory (unless prevented by environment variable)


The temporary directory is created in the /tmp directory. When the script
terminates, the test directory is removed, unless the environment variable
ETM_TEST_CLEANUP has the value "N".


Disk layout
-----------

The t/ directory holds the test cases. The t/data/ subdirectory holds the
data used by the test cases. Each test may have a separate subdirectory
within the t/data/ directory for its own test data.
